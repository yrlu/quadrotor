# minimum snap trajectory planning in MATLAB
This repository contains sample code in MATLAB for minimum snap trajectory planning described in http://blog.csdn.net/q597967420/article/details/73647190.
This README provides a brief overview of our trajectory generation utilities with some examples.

## Required
1. MATLAB(R2013a is tested)

## How to run
There are 4 demo codes in 2D space, you can directly run these and see results.

 - demo1: minimum snap trajectory planning with waypoints **strong constrants**(equality constraints).
 - demo2: minimum snap trajectory planning with **corridor constraints**(iequality constraints).
 - demo3: minimum snap trajectory planning with waypoints strong constrants by **close form** solution.
 - demo4: minimum snap trajectory planning with **guiding path**

## Licence
The source code is released under GPLv3 license.
